# LQG Simulation Tool

A Python-based simulation tool for exploring concepts in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG).

## Project Structure

- `lqg_simulation/`: Main package directory.
  - `core/`: Core data structures like `SpinNetwork`, `Node`, `Link`.
  - `mathematics/`: Mathematical functions, including Wigner symbols, etc.
  - `dynamics/`: Code related to the evolution of spin networks, transition amplitudes. (Planned)
  - `plotting/`: Visualization utilities.
  - `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities.
  - `examples/`: Example scripts demonstrating how to use the tool.
  - `tests/`: Unit tests for the package.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies. (To be added)
- `setup.py`: Script for packaging and distribution. (To be added)

## Current Features (In Development)

- Basic spin network representation (nodes, links with spin-j values).
- Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbol calculations (using Sympy).
- Placeholder vertex amplitude calculation.
- Simple 2D spin network visualization (using NetworkX & Matplotlib).

## Getting Started (Example)

```python
# (This is a placeholder - will be updated as features are implemented)
# from lqg_simulation.core import SpinNetwork

# Create a spin network
# sn = SpinNetwork()
# n1 = sn.add_node(node_name="N1")
# n2 = sn.add_node(node_name="N2")
# sn.add_link(n1, n2, spin_j=1.0, link_name="L12")

# sn.display()

# Visualize (planned)
# from lqg_simulation.plotting import plot_spin_network
# plot_spin_network(sn)
```

## Development

(Instructions for setting up a development environment, running tests, etc., will be added here.)

```bash
# Example:
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# pytest
```
