    """
    Calculates a placeholder amplitude for a vertex (node) in a spin network.

    This is a highly simplified placeholder. Real LQG vertex amplitudes (e.g., EPRL-FK model)
    are much more complex, often involving integrations over group elements, sums over
    representations, and specific combinations of 15j symbols (or related objects like booster/fusion coefficients).

    For this placeholder, we consider a 4-valent node. The amplitude will be based on a Wigner 6j symbol
    formed from the spins of the four incident links and a chosen "internal" or "intertwiner" spin.
    The choice of how these spins map to a 6j symbol is somewhat arbitrary in this placeholder context
    but serves to use the implemented Wigner symbols.

    If the node is not 4-valent, this placeholder will return 1.0 (trivial amplitude).

    Args:
        node: The Node object for which to calculate the amplitude.
        network: The SpinNetwork containing the node and its links.
        intertwiner_spin: An effective "intertwiner" spin for the vertex.
                          If None, a default (e.g., 1.0 or smallest possible) might be chosen,
                          or the function might indicate it's required for a non-trivial result.
                          For this placeholder, let's default it if the node is 4-valent.

    Returns:
        A float representing the placeholder vertex amplitude.

    # The 6th spin is also arbitrary for this placeholder. Let's fix it to S(1) for now.
    # This particular arrangement is just to use the function; it's not derived from a specific model here.
    # A more physically motivated 6j for a 4-vertex intertwiner might be:
    # { j_a j_b J_ab }
    # { j_c j_d J_cd } with J_ab = J_cd = chosen_J_int (this is not quite right, it's usually {j1 j2 J12; j3 j4 J12; j1 j3 J13; ...})
    # Actually, the evaluation of a 4-intertwiner (a "dot" in Penrose notation) is itself a 6j symbol
    # if you view it as connecting (j1,j2)->J_int and (j3,j4)->J_int, then the amplitude
    # to go from coupling j1,j2 first to coupling j1,j4 first involves a 6j symbol:
    # {j1 j2 J12}
    # {j3 j4 J_int}  <- this is not a 6j, this is a contraction.
    #
    # The actual value of an intertwiner (normalization) can be related to a 6j symbol.
    # For instance, the "tetrahedron" graph (dual to a 4-valent node) has an amplitude of a 6j symbol.
    # Let the 4 incident edges be 1,2,3,4. Let the intertwiner spin be J_int.
    # The 6j symbol could be {j1 j2 J_int ; j3 j4 some_other_spin}.
    # Let's use the spins of the 4 edges and the intertwiner spin.
    # Consider a tetrahedron with edge lengths j1, j2, j3, j4, j_int_diag1, j_int_diag2.
    # A common 6j symbol is {j_a j_b j_e}
    #                        {j_d j_c j_f}
    # Let's map: j_a=j1, j_b=j2, j_c=j3, j_d=j4
    # We need two more spins. One is chosen_J_int. What about the 6th one?
    # For a simple placeholder, let it be related to chosen_J_int or another incident spin.
    # Let's use: j1, j2, j3, j4, chosen_J_int, and chosen_J_int again (this is a common pattern for {jjJ, jjJ})

    # Placeholder: Use {j1, j2, chosen_J_int} and {j3, j4, chosen_J_int} as triads.
    # This would be relevant for a 6j symbol: {j1 j2 J_int}
    #                                       {j3 j4 J_int'} (where J_int could be j_aux)
    #                                       {k1 k2 k3  }
    # Let's use: j1, j2, j3 as the top row of 6j, and j4, chosen_J_int, chosen_J_int as bottom row.
    # This is arbitrary but uses the function.

    val_6j = calculate_wigner_6j(j1, j2, j3, j4, chosen_J_int, chosen_J_int)

    # The amplitude could be this 6j symbol itself, or (2*J_int+1) * 6j_symbol, etc.
    # For this placeholder, just return the 6j symbol value.
    # A common factor is (2j+1) for dimensions of representations.

    # for a tetrahedron graph (which is dual to a 4-valent vertex in 3D Regge calculus or spinfoams)
    # is directly a {6j} symbol using the 6 edge spins of the tetrahedron.
    # If j1,j2,j3,j4 are external edges of the node, and we have two internal "virtual" edges
    # (representing the intertwiner choices) with spins J_int1, J_int2, this gets complicated.
    #
    # Alternative simple placeholder using 3j symbols:
    # Imagine coupling (j1,m1) + (j2,m2) -> (J_int, M_int)
    # And (j3,m3) + (j4,m4) -> (J_int, -M_int) (to make total M=0)

    # Sum_{m_i, M_int} C(j1,m1,j2,m2;J_int,M_int) * C(j3,m3,j4,m4;J_int,-M_int) * P(m_i)
    # where P(m_i) is some projector or state definition. This is too complex for a placeholder.

    # Let's stick to the (2J_int+1) * {j1 j2 j3 / j4 J_int J_int} as defined.
    # This is just a placeholder calculation.
